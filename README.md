I spend a lot of time listening to music on Spotify (I'm listening to some jams as I write this now). When it comes to my music taste though, I am not much of a trend setter. Occasionally, however, when I look at the number of streams on Spotify of a new song, it surprises me - sometimes with a large number, sometimes with a undeservingly low number. And with this, I wondered if there was a way to predict the popularity of a song. Spotify has over 155 million users and each of their songs are tracked with streams and acoustic variables, making it a great dataset for analyzing music.

This tutorial will walk you through using machine learning to predict the popularity of a song based on these acoustic variables, plus a little addition of creating a recommendation system with K-nearest-neighbors.
